Quantitative Modeling

Model - understanding misconceptions, limitation and value of a business Processs. 

Hockey sticks - exponential increase


1. Linear Model
	Expected Price = -260 + 3721 Weight

2. Non Linear (Exponential)
	Cases = 6.69 e^0.18 Weeks (Ebola Cases)

3. -ve Association (Power)
	Quantity = 60,000 Price^-2.5
	(Demand models)

4. Logistic function - 
	Uptake of new product
	Prop = e^2(year - 2.5)/ 1 + e^2(year - 2.5)

In Practice
1. Prediction Analytics
2. Forecasting - Time Series
3. Optimization - Demand maximize profit
4. Ranking and targeting - 
5. Scenarios what-if
6. Interpreting coefficients
7. Sensitive analysis (assumption)

Benifits
1. Identification of gaps
2. Assumptions 
3. Well-defined description of business process
4. Institutional memory
5. Decision support tool
6. Serendipitous insight generator

Modeling process workflow
1. Identify inputs and outputs
2. Define Scope
3. Formulate model
4. Perform sensitivity analysis
5. Validate model forecasts
6. Fit for purpose ?
	a Yes - implement model
	b No - go to 1/2/3

Modeling lexicon
1. Empirical <-> Theoretical
	Data driven empirical model
	Theory driven theoretical model
2. Determinsitic vs probabilistic/stochastic
3. Discrete vs continuous
	Discrete - digital watch
	Continuous - analog watch
4. Static - single snapshot
   Dynamic - movement from state to state


y = mx + b (m = Slop is constant)

1. Linear
	Absolute increase in x => Absolute increase in y
  
2. Log
	diminishing returns to scale
	constant proportial change in x absolute change in y

    log is opposite of exponential

    y = logb(x) - natural log
    
3. Exponential
	y = e^mx
	Absolute chnange in x related to relative percent increase in y

4. Power
	model all sorts of functions
	percent change in x => m percent change in y
y = x^m
