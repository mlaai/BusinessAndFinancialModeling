E(Y|X) = b0 + b1X

Correlation -1<= r <=1

Predictive analytics
Prediction interval
Prospecting for opportunities
Method of least squares - minimizes the sum of squares of vertical distance from points to the line

1. decompose the data, line and residual

R^2 - variability in Y
Root mean squared error - spread of points about the fitted regression line
