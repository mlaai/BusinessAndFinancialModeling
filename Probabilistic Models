Probabilistic Models

Random variables 
Probability distribution

1. Incorporate uncertainity
2. Quantifying risks

Regression model
1. Works on data
2. Reverse engineer on data
3. Data as input , best fitting line
4. less noise more precise

Probability trees
1. Notice program
	First Alert - 90% Infringe 10% Stop infringe
	Second Alert = 85%, 15%
	Third Alert = 80%, 20%

P(Stop Infringing) = 1*0.1 + 0.9*0.15 + 0.9*0.85*0.2 


Monte Carlo simulation

Q = 60000*Price^-2.5
p(opt) = c*b/(1+b)

Markov model
1. discrete time state space transitions
2. Probability transition matrix

Building blocks of probability models
1. Discrete Random variables
2. Continuous random variable
	percent change
mean
variance
standard deviation

Bernoulli Distribution

Success = 1 ; Failure = 0
mean = E(X) = 1*p + 0 * (1-p) = p
variance = E(X - mean)^2 = ((1-p)^2)*p + ((0-p)^2)*(1-p) = p(1-p)
standard deviation = sqrt(p(1-p))

Binomial Distribution
independent Bernoulli Trials
P(AandB) = P(A) * P(B)

binomial coefficient = n!/x!(n-x)!

P(X=x) = binomial coefficent * p^x * (1-p)^(n-x)

Normal Distribution (bell curve)
mean and standard distribution


Empirical Rule for normal distribution
one standard deviation = 68%
two standard deviation = 95%
three standard deviation = 99.7%
