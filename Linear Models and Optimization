linear model
y = mx + b

if x goes up by 1 unit y goes up by m units

Interpretation 

Cost function
	C = 100 + 30q

Total Cost = (b = fixed cost) + Rate variable cost

Time to produce
T = 2 + 0.25q
Total Time = setup time + work rate
b = setup time
m = work rate


Linear programming (LP)
1. for optimization problems
2. incorporate constraints

Growth in discrete time
1. No. of customers at time t
2. Revenue in quarter q
3. Value of investment

linear (additive) growth vs proportionate 

simple interest(linear) vs compound interest(exponential)

Constant multiplier
if increase of 5% then 1.05
if decrease of 5% then 0.95

Rounding

Sum of geometric series is a quantitative formula
s(t) = P(0) * ((1-theta^t+1)/(1-theta))

Present and future value
Time value of money

Uses of present value
1. discounting invetments
2. Annuity - fixed payments over a specified and finite time period
3. Lifetime customer value

Countinuous compounding
P(t) = P(0) e^rt r= R/100
